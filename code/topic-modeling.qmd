```{r}
#| include: false
my_mirror <- "http://mirrors.xmission.com/gutenberg/"
```

## Download data

First download data to use in modeling:

https://www.gutenberg.org/browse/scores/top

Replace one to four of the books below with your own choice(s).

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(gutenbergr)

books <- gutenberg_download(c(36, 158, 164, 345),
                            meta_fields = "title",
                            mirror = my_mirror)
books %>%
  count(title)
```

What do you predict will happen if we run the following code?

**PREDICT WITH YOUR NEIGHBOR BEFORE YOU RUN**

```{r}
books_by_document <- books %>%
  group_by(title) %>%
  mutate(document = row_number() %/% 500) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  unite(document, title, document)

books_by_document
```

Someone has TORN YOUR BOOKS APART!!!

## Let's use topic modeling to put your books back together

As a first step, let's tokenize and tidy these chapters.

```{r}
library(tidytext)

word_counts <- books_by_document %>%
  ___ %>%
  anti_join(___) %>%
  count(document, word, sort = TRUE)

word_counts
```

Next, let's **cast** to a sparse matrix. 

How many features and observations do you have?

```{r}
words_sparse <- word_counts %>%
  ___(document, word, n)

___(words_sparse)
___(words_sparse)
```

Train a topic model.

```{r}
library(stm)

topic_model <- stm(___, K = 4, 
                   init.type = "Spectral")

summary(topic_model)
```

## Explore the output of topic modeling

The word-topic probabilities are called the "beta" matrix.

```{r}
document_topics <- tidy(topic_model, ___)

document_topics
```

What are the highest probability words in each topic?

**U N S C R A M B L E**

```{r}
top_terms <- document_topics %>%

ungroup() %>%

group_by(topic) %>%

arrange(topic, -beta)

slice_max(beta, n = 10) %>%
```

Let's build a visualization.

```{r}
top_terms %>%
  mutate(term = fct_reorder(term, beta)) %>%
  ggplot(___) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(vars(topic), scales = "free")
```

People who work with topic models have come up with alternate metrics for identifying important words:

- FREX = high frequency *and* high exclusivity
- lift = topic-word distribution divided by word count distribution

```{r}
tidy(___, matrix = "frex")
tidy(___, matrix = "lift")
```

The document-topic probabilities are called "gamma".

```{r}
documents_gamma <- tidy(topic_model, ___,
                        document_names = rownames(words_sparse))

documents_gamma
```

How well did we do in putting our books back together into the 4 topics?

What do you predict will happen if we run the following code?

**PREDICT WITH YOUR NEIGHBOR BEFORE YOU RUN**

```{r}
documents_parsed <- document_gamma %>%
  ___(document, c("title", "document"), 
           sep = "_", convert = TRUE)

documents_parsed
```

Let's visualize the results.

**U N S C R A M B L E**

```{r}
documents_parsed %>%

ggplot(aes(factor(topic), gamma)) +

facet_wrap(vars(title))

mutate(title = fct_reorder(title, gamma * topic)) %>%

geom_boxplot() +
```


## Train many topic models

Let's train a topic model at several different values for `K`.

```{r}
library(furrr)
plan(multicore)

many_models <- tibble(___) %>%
  mutate(topic_model = future_map(
    K, ~stm(words_sparse, K = ., verbose = FALSE))
  )

many_models
```

Now let's evaluate each of these models.

```{r}
heldout <- make.heldout(words_sparse)

k_result <- many_models %>%
  mutate(exclusivity        = map(topic_model, exclusivity),
         semantic_coherence = map(topic_model, semanticCoherence, words_sparse),
         eval_heldout       = map(topic_model, eval.heldout, heldout$missing),
         residual           = map(topic_model, checkResiduals, words_sparse),
         bound              = map_dbl(topic_model, function(x) max(x$convergence$bound)),
         lfact              = map_dbl(topic_model, function(x) lfactorial(x$settings$dim$K)),
         lbound             = bound + lfact,
         iterations         = map_dbl(topic_model, function(x) length(x$convergence$bound)))

k_result
```

We can visualize the model metrics.

```{r}
k_result %>%
  transmute(K,
            `Lower bound`         = lbound,
            Residuals             = ___(residual, "dispersion"),
            `Semantic coherence`  = ___(semantic_coherence, mean), 
            `Held-out likelihood` = ___(eval_heldout, "expected.heldout")) %>%  
  gather(Metric, Value, -K) %>%
  ggplot(aes(K, Value, color = Metric)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~Metric, scales = "free_y")
```

We can also look at exclusivity and semantic coherence for _each_ topic.

```{r}
k_result %>%
  select(K, exclusivity, semantic_coherence) %>%
  filter(K %in% c(3, 6, 10)) %>%
  unnest(cols = c(exclusivity, semantic_coherence)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(semantic_coherence, exclusivity, 
             color = factor(K))) +
  geom_point()
```
